ISO Filters
===========
Adds `filters`_ for interpreting standard codes and identifiers, including:

- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 country codes.
- ISO 4217 currency codes.
- IETF Language Tags (aka BCP 47).

Requirements
------------
ISO Filters is known to be compatible with the following Python versions:

- 3.14
- 3.13
- 3.12

.. note::
   I'm only one person, so to keep from getting overwhelmed, I'm only committing
   to supporting the 3 most recent versions of Python.  ISO Filters may work in
   versions not listed here — there just won't be any test coverage to prove it
   😇

Installation
------------
This package is an extension for the `Filters library`_, so you can install it
as an extra to ``phx-filters``::

   pip install phx-filters[iso]

.. important::
   Make sure to install `phx-filters`, **not** `filters`.  I created the latter
   at a previous job years ago, and after I left they never touched that project
   again and stopped responding to my emails — so in the end I had to fork it 🤷

If desired, you can install this package separately.  This allows you to control
the package version separately from ``phx-filters``::

   pip install phx-filters-iso

Running Unit Tests
------------------
Install the package with the ``test-runner`` extra to set up the necessary
dependencies, and then you can run the tests with the ``tox`` command::

   pip install -e .[test-runner]
   tox -p

To run tests in the current virtualenv::

   python -m unittest

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs`_.

Source files for this project's documentation can be found in the
`phx-filters repo`_.

Releases
--------
.. important::

   Make sure to build releases off of the ``main`` branch, and check that all
   changes from ``develop`` have been merged before creating the release!

1. One-time setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a `PyPI API token`_ if you don't have one, then install ``keyring`` as
a global tool and store the token:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv tool install keyring
    uv tool update-shell
    keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__

Paste your ``pypi-...`` token when prompted.

2. Publish to PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Bump the version (updates ``pyproject.toml`` and ``uv.lock``)::

    uv version <version>

#. Commit the changes::

    git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
    git commit

#. Publish to PyPI::

    uv publish --username __token__

3. Create GitHub Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Create an annotated tag and push to GitHub::

    git tag -a <version> -m "Release <version>"
    git push origin <version>

   ``<version>`` must match the updated version number in ``pyproject.toml``.

#. Go to the `Releases page for the repo`_.
#. Click ``Draft a new release``.
#. Select the tag that you created in step 1.
#. Specify the title of the release (e.g., ``ISO Filters v1.2.3``).
#. Write a description for the release.  Make sure to include:
   - Credit for code contributed by community members.
   - Significant functionality that was added/changed/removed.
   - Any backwards-incompatible changes and/or migration instructions.
   - SHA256 hashes of the build artefacts.
#. GPG-sign the description for the release (ASCII-armoured).
#. Attach the build artefacts to the release.
#. Click ``Publish release``.
